# openvr-customhmd
DIY attempt for making a HTC Vive clone (STM32 based headtracker & controller, with positional tracking) from cheap hardware (except the heavily modified Sony HMZ-T2 headset I use for this project). Includes OpenVR driver with USB camera support. 



Custom resolution to fake 3d signal for headset: (same timings for nvidia cards)
